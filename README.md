**1.Problem **
One key challenge under SDG 13 is predicting short-term weather changes and understanding climate patterns so people can plan ahead — especially in regions affected by extreme weather.
Many communities lack tools that give simple, data-driven weather predictions.

**2.How the Project Helps**
It integrates machine learning and real-time data to predict weather conditions for any city.
Here’s how the code contributes:

**Python (Flask + ML model)**
Fetches real-time weather data from an external API.
Uses machine learning algorithms to analyze weather patterns.
Predicts near-term temperature or conditions.
Provides the prediction through a web API (/predict).

**HTML Frontend (User Interface)**
Allows users to enter a city name.
Displays predicted weather results (e.g., temperature, conditions).
Shows raw data fetched from the API in a clear and user-friendly way.

**CSS (Styling)**
Enhances the design to make the web app clean, modern, and accessible.
Helps users interact with data easily.
